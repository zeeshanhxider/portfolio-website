              Hi, I&apos;m zeeshan 👋🏼 — a Software Engineering student at NUST
              and an aspiring AI Engineer with a passion for turning ideas into
              real-world solutions. Alongside my degree, I&apos;m also part of
              AIESEC in Business Development, where I get to grow my teamwork,
              communication, and leadership skills outside of the classroom.
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              My main focus is in the field of Large Language Models (LLMs),
              where I&apos;m actively exploring Retrieval-Augmented Generation
              (RAG) and multimodal RAG systems. I love working on how AI can
              combine reasoning with external knowledge to become more reliable
              and useful in real-world applications. Beyond research, I focus on
              building production-ready, end-to-end applications that are
              designed with real users in mind — applying concepts from DevOps
              to ensure scalability, reliability, and smooth deployment.
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              While I&apos;m comfortable across the stack, I especially enjoy
              the frontend and UI/UX side of development, where design meets
              functionality. I see every project as a chance to push my
              problem-solving skills, creativity, and technical depth further.
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              Outside of coding, you&apos;ll usually find me (struggling) at the
              gym, discovering new music, appreciating different forms of art or
              just goofing around :)
              <br></br>
